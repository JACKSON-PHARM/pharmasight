# PharmaSight – Marketing & Positioning Guide  
## For a pharmacist selling to pharmacists (one-month plan)

You built PharmaSight **as a pharmacist**. That’s your strongest asset: you know the daily pain (stock-outs, expiry, KRA, breaking bulk, multi-branch chaos). This guide is about how to **position yourself**, **who to talk to**, and **what to do week-by-week** in your first month of marketing.

---

## 1. How to position yourself

### Your story (use this everywhere)

**Short version:**  
*“I’m a pharmacist. I got tired of software that didn’t understand how we actually work—FEFO, breaking bulk, KRA compliance, multi-branch stock. So I built PharmaSight with the features we actually need.”*

**Why it works:**  
- Builds trust: you’re one of them, not “a tech company.”  
- Explains the product: built from real pharmacy workflow.  
- Differentiates: “by a pharmacist, for pharmacists.”

### Positioning statement (one sentence)

*“PharmaSight is a pharmacy management system built by a pharmacist for Kenyan pharmacies—inventory that thinks the way you do (FEFO, breaking bulk, KRA-compliant), so you spend less time on stock and more on patients.”*

Use this on your landing page, in emails, and when someone asks “What is it?”

### What to emphasize (features → benefits)

| Feature in the app | How to say it to a pharmacist |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| FEFO, expiry tracking | “Sell expiry-first so you don’t lose money on expired stock.” |
| Breaking bulk, base units | “Packs and pieces handled correctly—no more manual conversion errors.” |
| KRA-compliant invoicing | “Invoices and VAT that satisfy KRA and your auditor.” |
| Multi-branch inventory | “One system for all branches; see and move stock across sites.” |
| Cost-based pricing & margins | “Know your real cost and margin per product and batch.” |
| Procurement recommendations | “Get suggestions on what to reorder so you don’t run out.” |
| Document branding, stamps, signatures | “Official POs and documents with your stamp and signature for compliance.” |
| Excel import | “Bring your existing product list in from Excel instead of typing everything.” |

Lead with **outcomes** (save time, avoid losses, stay compliant), then mention the feature.

## 2. Who to target first

- **Ideal first customers:**  
  - Owner-pharmacists or pharmacy managers (1–3 branches).  
  - People already frustrated with their current system or spreadsheets.  
  - Those who care about KRA, stock accuracy, and expiry.

- **Where they are:**  
  - WhatsApp groups (pharmacist / pharmacy owner groups).  
  - PPB / professional events (when they happen).  
  - LinkedIn (pharmacists in Kenya, pharmacy management).  
  - Referrals from your own network (other pharmacists you know).

- **Who to avoid at the start:**  
  - Very large chains (long sales cycle).  
  - People who “just want the cheapest” and don’t value compliance or inventory control.

## 3. One-month marketing plan (week by week)

### Week 1: Foundation and message

**Goal:** Be ready to talk about PharmaSight clearly and consistently.

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Write your “pharmacist-built” story in 3 lines. Save it in your phone notes. |
| 2 | List 20 pharmacist contacts (colleagues, ex-classmates, group admins). Mark who might try it or refer you. |
| 3 | Prepare a **short demo**: 5–7 minutes showing: login → view stock → create a sale → print/view invoice. Record it on your phone if possible. |
| 4 | If you don’t have one: create a simple **landing page** (even one page: what it is, who it’s for, “Built by a pharmacist,” contact/WhatsApp). |
| 5 | Draft one **WhatsApp intro message** (see template below). Test it on 1–2 close contacts and adjust. |

**WhatsApp intro template (short):**  
*“Hi [Name], hope you’re well. I’ve been working on a pharmacy management system designed around how we actually work—FEFO, breaking bulk, KRA invoices, multi-branch. I’d value your feedback. Can I send you a short demo link or show you a 5-min screen share?”*

---

### Week 2: Soft launch to your network

**Goal:** Get 5–10 people to see the product or demo.

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Send your WhatsApp intro to 5 contacts from your list. Personalize the first line for each. |
| 2 | Post once in 1–2 pharmacist WhatsApp groups: “I built a pharmacy system as a pharmacist; would love feedback from anyone running a pharmacy.” Add your contact. |
| 3 | If you have LinkedIn: post your “pharmacist-built” story + one benefit (e.g. “So we stop losing money to expiry”). Add link to landing page or “DM for demo.” |
| 4 | Follow up with anyone who replied in Week 1. Offer a 10–15 min call or screen share. |
| 5 | Note every objection or question (price, features, “we already use X”). Use these to refine your message. |

---

### Week 3: Demos and feedback

**Goal:** Do 3–5 live demos and turn feedback into improvements and testimonials.

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1–2 | Schedule and run demos with everyone who said “yes.” Focus on their workflow (e.g. “How do you do stock now?”) then show how PharmaSight does it. |
| 2 | After each demo: ask “What would need to be true for you to use this?” and “What’s the one thing that would make you recommend it?” |
| 3 | If someone is happy: ask for a short **testimonial** (1–2 sentences) and permission to use name/pharmacy (or “Pharmacist, Nairobi”). |
| 4 | Post again in WhatsApp/LinkedIn: “Thanks to those who gave feedback; here’s what we’re improving…” (builds credibility). |
| 5 | Add 5 more contacts and send the same intro. Reuse the best wording from Week 2. |

---

### Week 4: First paying (or pilot) customers

**Goal:** Convert at least 1–2 people to a pilot or paid use.

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Decide your offer: e.g. “First 3 months at X KES” or “Free 1-month pilot, then Y KES/month.” Keep it simple. |
| 2 | Email/WhatsApp everyone who had a demo: “We’re opening a few spots for pharmacies to start in [month]. Here’s the offer. Interested?” |
| 3 | For anyone who says “maybe later”: ask “What would need to change for you to start in the next 2 months?” Note answers. |
| 4 | If you have a testimonial: add it to your landing page and to your intro message. |
| 5 | Write down: (a) how many people you contacted, (b) how many demos, (c) how many said yes/no/maybe. Use this to plan Month 2. |

---

## 4. Simple metrics to track (month 1)

| Metric | How to track |
|--------|----------------|
| Contacts reached | Number of people you sent the intro to (WhatsApp, email, LinkedIn). |
| Demos done | Number of live or recorded demos viewed. |
| Testimonials | Number of short quotes you can use (with permission). |
| Pilots / paying | Number who started a pilot or paid. |

You don’t need a fancy tool. A small table in a doc or spreadsheet is enough.

## 5. How to market (channels, in order of impact for you)

1. **WhatsApp (personal + groups)**  
   - Easiest and where pharmacists already are.  
   - Use personal messages for demos; groups for awareness and “who wants to see a demo?”

2. **Word of mouth / referrals**  
   - After a good demo or pilot: “Who else do you know who might benefit?”  
   - Offer a small incentive later (e.g. one month free for a referred pharmacy) if you want.

3. **LinkedIn**  
   - Post your story and one benefit every 1–2 weeks.  
   - Search “pharmacist Kenya” or “pharmacy owner” and connect with a short, personal note.

4. **Simple landing page**  
   - One page: problem → solution → “Built by a pharmacist” → contact.  
   - Link from WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and email.

5. **Events (when they happen)**  
   - PPB or pharmacy association events: go with “I built a system for us; here’s my card and a 5-min demo.”

Avoid spending money on ads in month 1. Your time is better in direct conversations and demos.

---

## 6. Handling common questions

- **“How much does it cost?”**  
  - Have one simple option (e.g. “X KES per branch per month” or “Pilot for 1 month, then Y”).  
  - If you’re still deciding: “We’re doing a few pilot pharmacies at [price]; I can add you to the list.”

- **“We already use [other system].”**  
  - “That’s fine. When you’re ready to compare or if you hit limits with them, we’re here. Can I leave you a short demo link?”

- **“Is it only for Kenya?”**  
  - “Right now it’s built for Kenyan pharmacies—KRA, our units, our compliance. We can talk about other markets later.”

- **“Did you build it yourself?”**  
  - “I’m a pharmacist; I designed it around our workflow and worked with developers to build it. So the features are what we actually need.”

---

## 7. After month 1

- Double down on what worked (e.g. “WhatsApp + demo” or “LinkedIn + one group”).  
- Turn testimonials into a short “What pharmacists say” section.  
- Consider one simple referral offer (e.g. “Refer a pharmacy, get one month free”).  
- Revisit pricing based on what people said they’d pay.

---

You don’t need to be a software developer to sell PharmaSight. You need to be **clear** (what it is, who it’s for), **consistent** (same story everywhere), and **visible** (WhatsApp, demos, one or two posts). Your domain knowledge is the reason others will listen. Use this plan as a starting point and adjust each week based on what gets responses.

Good luck—you’ve got a strong story and a product that speaks to real pharmacy pain.
